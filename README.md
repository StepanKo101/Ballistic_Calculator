# Ballistic_Calculator
This is a ballistic calculator for 82mm mortar from ArmA 3 with ACE3 mod.
"B-but the game already has a ballistic computer attached to every mortar and artillery unit!" 
or
"B-but ACE3 mod already provides you with tools for manual calculations for shooting your mortar!"

Yes & yes. This project has only one use: Antistasi Ultimate + ACE3 mod.
The thing is, if you use both of these mods, you won't be able to consistently use map tools on your map because of some conflict or a bug, I dunno.
Because of this I decided to make a calculator in C++ as my first serious (more or less) project.
